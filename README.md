# Naive-Bayes-NLP-Case-Study

#### This is an end to end Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) case study.
#### It's a kaggle competition. The dataset and project description can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/donorschoose-application-screening/data 

### Real world machine learning in action - Solution Approach 
1. Extensive Data cleaning with regular expressions and python built in string.
2. Vectorizing text data - Bag of words, TfIdf etc.
3. Naive Bayes model - on BOW-TEXT Features, Hyper parameter tuning, ROC-Auc train-test (bias-variance) graph, 
4. Naive-Bayes model - on Tfidf-TEXT Features, Hyper parameter tuning, ROC-Auc train-test (bias-variance) graph, 
5. Comparison of the models
